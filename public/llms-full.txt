# OpenClaw — Full Documentation

> Deploy an autonomous AI agent on Telegram in 60 seconds.

Website: https://open-clawbot.com

## Overview

OpenClaw is a platform that enables anyone to deploy a fully autonomous AI agent on Telegram without writing a single line of code. Each agent runs as a persistent daemon on dedicated infrastructure, maintaining long-term memory, browsing the web, managing tasks, and operating 24/7.

## Core Features

### Persistent Memory
Your agent remembers every conversation. It builds context over time, learning your preferences, projects, and needs. Unlike stateless chatbots, OpenClaw agents maintain continuity across sessions.

### Web Browsing
Agents can browse the web in real-time using a built-in browser. They can research topics, summarize articles, check facts, and find information on your behalf.

### Task Management
Create tasks, set reminders, and manage to-do lists through natural conversation. Your agent tracks everything and follows up proactively.

### Always On
OpenClaw agents run as persistent daemons on cloud infrastructure. They're always available, respond instantly, and never go offline.

### Personality Customization
Choose from preset personalities (Operator, Friendly, Professional, Minimal) or customize your agent's behavior and communication style.

### Autonomous Operation
Agents don't just respond — they can take initiative. With configurable autonomy levels, your agent can proactively check in, provide updates, and handle tasks independently.

## Use Cases

### Personal Assistant
Schedule reminders, manage tasks, take notes, and organize your life through natural Telegram conversations.

### Research Helper
Ask your agent to research any topic. It browses the web, summarizes findings, and remembers everything for future reference.

### Business Autopilot
Handle customer inquiries, draft responses, automate repetitive workflows, and keep your business running around the clock.

### Creative Partner
Brainstorm ideas, write content, get feedback on drafts, and collaborate on creative projects with an AI that knows your style.

### Customer Support
Deploy an agent that handles customer questions, provides instant responses, and escalates complex issues — available 24/7.

### Knowledge Base
Your agent accumulates knowledge over time. Tell it important information once, and it remembers forever — building a personal knowledge base you can query anytime.
